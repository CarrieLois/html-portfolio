<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm just an average lady, who decided to switch careers at 40+ years old. I love creating things and for some reason coding is super fun, so here we are. Woohoo! Wish me luck.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding I can typically be found creating things. I love to knit, crochet, paint, draw, sculpt, and do woodwork.</p>

<p>If I'm not doing on of the above activities I'm probably in my happy place hanging out with my family and animals.</p>
